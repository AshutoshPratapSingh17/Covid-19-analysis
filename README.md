🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis with Python
This project provides an in-depth analysis and visualization of the COVID-19 pandemic using Python. It leverages publicly available datasets to explore the trends, patterns, and impact of COVID-19 on different countries over time.

📁 Project Overview
Title: COVID-19 Analysis using Python

Libraries Used: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

Goal: Visualize and analyze the spread, severity, and recovery trends of COVID-19 worldwide

Approach: Data Wrangling ➤ Time-Series Analysis ➤ Comparative Visualization ➤ Insight Extraction

📊 Key Features
📆 Time-Series Visualization
Track confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries over time.

🌍 Country-wise Comparison
Compare case counts, recovery rates, and mortality rates across multiple countries.

📌 Heatmaps & Trends
Understand correlations and highlight critical patterns using Seaborn heatmaps.

📈 Statistical Insights
Use NumPy and Pandas for data aggregation, moving averages, and rate calculations.

🧹 Clean Data Pipeline
Clean, normalize, and prepare raw COVID-19 data from sources like Johns Hopkins, WHO, etc.
